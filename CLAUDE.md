# EPL Predictor — read this first

A calibrated Premier League forecasting system: match Outcome probabilities, a simulated final table,
and an honest three-way scoreboard against the betting market and public pundits.

**Before writing any code, read these in order:**

1. [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md) — the glossary. Use these exact terms in code and in conversation.
2. [docs/DECISIONS.md](./docs/DECISIONS.md) — every decision, the measured evidence behind it, and the open risks.
3. [docs/adr/](./docs/adr/) — nine ADRs explaining the choices that look wrong until you know why.
4. [README.md](./README.md) — target numbers, data sources, build order, layout.

## The rule that outranks everything

**No future data, ever.** A Prediction may use only data timestamped strictly before its As-Of
Instant. If a change would make the model faster, simpler, or more accurate but blurs that line,
the answer is no.

## Things that look like bugs but are deliberate

Do not "fix" these without reading the linked ADR first:

- **Lower-league results are ingested** into an EPL predictor — E0 through E3. [ADR 0004](./docs/adr/0004-rate-the-whole-pyramid.md)
- **The benchmark is pre-match odds, not closing odds**, against convention. [ADR 0001](./docs/adr/0001-pre-match-odds-as-market-benchmark.md)
- **The model predicts weekly in batches** instead of per-fixture, deliberately using less information. [ADR 0002](./docs/adr/0002-weekly-prediction-rounds.md)
- **26 seasons are ingested but only 21 are scored.** [ADR 0008](./docs/adr/0008-burn-in-prefix-frozen-hyperparameters.md)
- **Dixon-Coles is fitted two different ways** — MLE and Bayesian. [ADR 0007](./docs/adr/0007-mle-for-matches-bayesian-for-projections.md)
- **The pundit's published scoreline is transformed before scoring.** [ADR 0003](./docs/adr/0003-calibrated-pundit-predictor.md)
- **Two prediction stores exist, not one**, and one of them must never be rewritten. [ADR 0005](./docs/adr/0005-split-prediction-ledger.md)
- **Refreshing a cached raw file archives the old bytes** into `superseded/` instead of replacing
  them, and **`Wimbledon`, `Milton Keynes Dons` and `AFC Wimbledon` are three separate Clubs**.
  Both are explained where they live — `src/epl/ingest/football_data.py` and `src/epl/clubs/table.py`.

## Never do this

- Never edit anything under `data/raw/` — it is a byte-identical cache of upstream files.
- Never rewrite a file under `outputs/live/` after its round's first kickoff. Supersede with a new
  As-Of Instant instead. That directory is evidence, not output.
- Never tune a hyperparameter using data from outside the Burn-In Window (2000/01–2004/05).
- Never report accuracy as the headline metric. RPS is primary; accuracy is for lay explanation only.

## Status

Design is complete and grilled.

**Stage 1 is built**: the Miniforge environment (`environment.yml`), the Football-Data ingester
(`src/epl/ingest/`) and the Club/Alias table (`src/epl/clubs/`, 115 Clubs across four tiers).

**Stage 2 is built**: Prediction Rounds (`src/epl/rounds.py`, issue #5) and the metrics module
(`src/epl/metrics/`, issue #6) — RPS, Brier, log loss, accuracy and the 10-bin reliability diagram,
every expected value worked by hand before any model uses it.

**Stage 3 is built**: the Predictor contract (`src/epl/predictors.py`), the split ledger
(`src/epl/ledger/`) and the Naive Baseline (`src/epl/benchmarks/naive.py`), issue #7 — one Predictor
walked over the whole Evaluation Window, stored, audited and scored at **0.22938 RPS** over 7,980
Fixtures and 952 Prediction Rounds.

`epl.models`, `epl.pundits` and `epl.simulate` are still documented shells, each naming the issue
that builds it.

Three things about stage 3 worth knowing before building on it:

- **A Predictor is handed `Evidence`, not an As-Of Instant.** Evidence is the corpus already cut at
  the instant, and it records what it hands over, so `inputs_seen` and `latest_input` on every
  stored row are a receipt. Do not add a Predictor that reads the corpus directly — that is the
  one way a leak can enter without an audit failing.
- **The scoreboard has no branch per Predictor and must not grow one.** Registering a Predictor is
  what puts it on the board; the ledger, the audits and the scoring are written once against the
  contract (spec, user story 16).
- **The row audit is two-tier on kickoff**, matching the As-Of rule: strictly-before where a
  kickoff time was recorded, and at-or-before where it was not. 313 Evaluation Window Fixtures are
  played on the very Tuesday or Friday they anchor to and are legitimately equal.

Two things about stage 2 worth knowing before building on it:

- **A Prediction Round's As-Of Instant is midnight at the start of its anchor day**, not the
  afternoon the market samples at. Nothing is played in between, so midnight withholds no data the
  market had — and it is the only choice checkable for the 437 Fixtures that kick off on their own
  anchor day with no recorded kickoff time. Football-Data records no kickoff time at all before
  2019/20 (7,220 of 9,880 Premier League Fixtures).
- **There are 1,189 Prediction Rounds, not the 1,332 the design recorded.** The anchor rule is
  stated as executable code and was kept; the unreproducible count was corrected. See
  [docs/DECISIONS.md](./docs/DECISIONS.md).

## What to build next

**Issue #8 — the Market Line and the Ceiling Line.** Closing #7 unblocked #8, #9 and #11 at once, so
the graph no longer picks for you. Take #8 first: it is the smaller of the two modelling tickets, it
is the opponent the whole project is measured against, and putting it on the board before Elo means
the first real model has something meaningful beside it from its first run rather than only a floor.
Both are Predictors registered against the contract stage 3 built. Two things about that contract
will come up in #8's first hour:

- **The Ceiling Line needs a decision the ledger deliberately does not make for it.** A Predictor
  sees `schema.VISIBLE_FIXTURE_COLUMNS`, and the closing odds are **not** on that list — they carry
  team news from after the As-Of Instant, so exposing them to every Predictor would be the leak the
  allow-list exists to prevent. The Ceiling Line is the one Predictor entitled to them, and it is a
  labelled exception rather than an oversight (ADR 0001). Decide explicitly how it gets them; do
  not just append them to the list.
- **The Market Line reads its odds off the Fixture, not off `Evidence`**, so its rows will record
  `inputs_seen = 0` and an empty `latest_input`. That is correct and audits clean — a Predictor
  that consumes no history has no history to leak, the same way a Pundit will. Do not "fix" it by
  making it touch the corpus.

**Issue #9 — pyramid-wide Elo** is equally unblocked and is what the README's build order lists
first. Either is defensible; do not do both at once. Check the graph before starting:

```
gh issue view <n> | sed -n '/## Blocked by/,$p'
```

Also ready: **issue #18**, the deferred-v2 stubs (XGBoost, Golden Boot, API-Football). It has been
unblocked since stage 1, needs nothing from the ledger, and is small — pick it up when a stage lands
and there is no appetite to start the next one.
